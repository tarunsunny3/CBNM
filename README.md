# Computer Based Numerical Methods

- Bisection Method - Used for finding roots of nonlinear equations by repeatedly bisecting an interval and selecting a subinterval in which a root exists.

- Newton-Raphson Method - An iterative method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeros) of a real-valued function.

- Secant Method - A root-finding algorithm that uses a sequence of roots of secant lines to better approximate the root.

- Simpson's Rule - A method for numerical integration that approximates the integral of a function by using parabolic segments.

- Euler's Method - A simple, first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations with a given initial value.

- Runge-Kutta Methods - A family of iterative methods for approximating solutions to ordinary differential equations, with the fourth-order method being the most commonly used.

- Gaussian Elimination - A method for solving systems of linear equations by transforming the system's matrix into an upper triangular form.
